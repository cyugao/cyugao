Hi! I am a PhD candidate in Industrial Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Please check out my home page and publications [here](https://cyugao.github.io).

My research design and analysis of optimization algorithms for trustworthy machine learning, including differentially private optimization, and robust optimization.
This year (2025), I am actively looking for machine learning / applied scientist / quantative researcher positions!
